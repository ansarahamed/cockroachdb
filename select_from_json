operator ->> returns text

The SELECT data->>'source' FROM tablename; query extracts the value associated with the source key from a JSON column named data in a PostgreSQL table. For each row, it returns the value of the source field.

For example, if the data column contains JSON objects like:

json
Copy code
{"source": "website", "type": "referral", "skus": [{}]}
{"source": "social_media", "type": "organic"}
{"source": "email", "type": "campaign"}
The query will return the values "website", "social_media", and "email" for the source field in respective rows. This is useful when you need to extract and display a specific key's value from JSON data in your table.
